Implements a round-robin scheduled thread system. Threads are executed in the order they are created, beginning with the main thread.

## Reflecton

1. What do you think was the motivation behind assigning this project in this class?

   To gain an understanding about multitasking and context switching.

1. What is the most important thing you learned in this project?

   I feel like I learned a lot about how memory is structured and how that structure affects what is currently being executed.

1. What do you wish you had spent more time on or done differently?

   I wish I started way earlier. There were a lot of edge cases that I couldn't properly account for.

1. What part of the project did you do your best work on?

   I think the queue and dequeue work as intended.

1. What was the most enjoyable part of this project?

   Thinking about threading from the perspective of the implementer rather than the user.

1. What was the least enjoyable part of this project?

   Not having enough time.

1. How could your instructor change this project to make it better next time?

   Give more time. More heavily encourage starting early.
